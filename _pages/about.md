Hi there! My name is Eirik Yates and I am a 3rd year student at Sheridan College, within the Honors Bachelor of Information Sciences (Cyber Security) program.

Since highschool, I've had a passion for dealing with tech and took as many computer related courses that I could. Combining this with my time spent at Sheridan, I've worked on many projects which have helped develop the skills necessary to grow within this field. As I pass the half way mark of my 4 year program, my passion for cyber security only continues to grow!

This page is dedicated towards docummenting my cyber security journey. As I continue to learn more about this field, I hope to share my thought process as to how I approach and sovled different projects, alongside my biggest takeaways from them!
