# Eirik Yates - Website

Hey there! If you're interested in seeing what I've been up to in my spare time, check out my website. I do CTF round-ups and generally showcase things that I've recently learned and found interesting (i.e Portswigger/TryHackMe Labs and academy material). Any personal projects will also be showcased here!

Go to [e1r1kk.github.io](https://e1r1kk.github.io/) to check it out! Thank you for stopping by!
