# Overview

On April 24th, (**MetaCTF**)[https://metactf.com/] hosted a Flash CTF competition, providing various challenges to see who could solve them the fastest. Although I didn't compete on the day of the competition, the challenges were still available after the competition ended, so I decided to take a stab at them to see what I could solve!

In this post, I will be showing my thought process and approach to solving these challenges. Out of the 5 challenges provided, I was able to solve 2 of them. However, I will updating this post if I solve more of them in the future.
